# Telegram Clone Channel

Telegram user bot to clone messages from one channel to another. 

The cloning is done after downloading the message and uploading it to the target channel. This means it is possible to clone messages from channels that do not allow forwarding.

```
API_ID: Your Telegram API ID
API_HASH: Your Telegram API Hash
MON_CHANNEL: The ID of the channel to monitor and forward messages from
TARGET_CHANNEL: The ID of the channel to forward messages to
```

## Limitations
Currently supports simply between two channels.

TODO: Add support to clone messages from multiple channels to one channel.
